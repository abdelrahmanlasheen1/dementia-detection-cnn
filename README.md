# ðŸ§  Detecting Dementia with CNNs

Hi! This is my deep learning project where I used the **OASIS MRI dataset** to classify brain MRI images into four categories of Alzheimer's progression:

- Non-Demented
- Very Mild Dementia
- Mild Dementia
- Moderate Dementia

I worked on this as part of my learning journey into medical image analysis and computer vision.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset I used is the **OASIS MRI dataset**, which is publicly available:

- [OASIS official website](https://www.oasis-brains.org/)

I assigned **400 images per class** (so the dataset was imbalanced overall), and organized them into folders like this:
